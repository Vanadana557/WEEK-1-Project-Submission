This study investigates the application of a linear regression model to predict solar power generation, 
leveraging the established relationship between readily available weather parameters like temperature, cloud cover, and
solar irradiance as input variables to forecast the output of a photovoltaic system. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies statistically significant correlations, 
allowing for reasonably accurate predictions of solar power production, 
which can be valuable for grid management and optimizing energy utilization strategies within a region.
